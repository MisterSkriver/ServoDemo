It is important that the wires are connected correctly. The servo has 3 wires in different colours: brown, orange and red. The red wire is to be connected to the power output, the brown to ground, and the red one to whichever port youâ€™re using.

Open & upload the ServoDemo.ino sketch and watch the magic happen ;)
